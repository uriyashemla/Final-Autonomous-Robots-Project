ROS2 package port for multi-robot autonomous exploration of map-explore. Currently tested on Foxy distros.
# About the project:
In this project our goal was to get the "robot" to navigate each space (not outer space) according to mapping and positioning (SLAM) and navigation algorithms.
We performed these operations with the help of the Ros.2 library together with RVIZ.
In order to display the simulation we used a TurtleBot simulator on top of Gazebo.
